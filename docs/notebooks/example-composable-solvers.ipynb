    "Firedrake relies on PETSc to do the heavy lifting for algebraic solves. If you don't provide any parameters, we just inherit the defaults from PETSc. Of course, we can change this, and probably want to so that we pick an appropriate solver for our problem. We already saw an example of this above, setting tolerances and the like. If you're familiar with PETSc options, this will already make sense, if not, a little explanation is in order. So we'll take a brief detour to discuss the \"programming language\" PETSc exposes through its options database.\n",
    "\n",
    "PETSc objects (such as solvers) are configurable at runtime, and the primary mechanism for doing so is through PETSc's _options database_. A PETSc object examines the database, and configures itself, when `setFromOptions` is called on it. For the solvers in Firedrake, this is arranged to happen when you call `solve`. The \"programming language\" for the options consists of two operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Value assignment -foo_type bar (equivalently in dict syntax `{\"foo_type\": \"bar\"}`)\n",
    "2. String concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "The former says \"set the `foo_type` key in the database to value `bar`\", the latter is used, in combination with object _prefixes_ to configure multiple objects _of the same type_ in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
