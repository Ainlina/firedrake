Firedrake '22
-------------
               
The slightly inaccurately named Firedrake '22 user and developer workshop will
be held at Dartington Hall in Totnes from 4-6 January 2023. The event is
cohosted by the University of Exeter and Imperial College London.

The workshop is an opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
provides Firedrake users with the opportunity to interact directly
with developers and other users.

Abstract submission
-------------------

Abstract submission will open soon. We expect that any attendee who wishes to
present their work will be able to.

Registration
------------

Registration will include meals and accommodation and early registration rates
will be £150 for students and £250 for others.
