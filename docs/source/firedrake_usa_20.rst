Firedrake USA '20
-----------------

For the very first time we'll be holding a Firedrake workshop in North
America. Firedrake USA '20 will be held on 10 and 11 February 2020 at
`the University of Washington <https://www.washington.edu>`_. That's
on the two days before `SIAM PP20
<https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/pp20>`_, which will
also be in Seattle.

The workshop will provide the opportunity for Firedrake users and
developers to engage with each other to communicate the ways that
Firedrake can be used in simulation science, the latest developments
in the project, and the future developments anticipated. The event
will provide Firedrake users with the opportunity to spend face to
face time with developers and other users.

Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

The workshop will start with a half day Firedrake tutorial for
interested new users and the main science programme will start at
lunchtime on 10 February. See the programme for detailed timings.
